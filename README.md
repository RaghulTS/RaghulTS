ðŸ‘‰ I'm a 17 year old student interested to develop skills in new technologies. When I was in 10th I wrote my first line of code starting with python.

ðŸ‘‰ I won a cash prize of â‚¹20000 in a hackthon in KGISL college (A coding competition) among 87 teams participated.

ðŸ‘‰ Now I have a decent experience and intermediate in programming languages like C++, PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT.

ðŸ‘‰ I have built websites using HTML | CSS | JAVASCRIPT | and they're hosted online live.
